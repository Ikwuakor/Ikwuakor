### Hi, my name is Uzo and welcome to my Github! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist, with a background in applied mathematics, probability and statistics who is proficient in Python/SQL data methods. I try to be a first principles thinker, striving to achieve a fundamental understanding of data science concepts from the ground up. I believe that this way of thinking lends itself towards improved interpretability, a sharpened ability to think through problems, adaptability in an ever-changing ecosystem and an eye towards what yet is still possible.

I'm currently learning ML Engineering (deploying models at scale) and creating my own packages.
